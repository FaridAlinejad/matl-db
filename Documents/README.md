#### How to Compile a Predicisional Draft Report Summarizing Experimental Measurements Submitted to the 2021 MaCFP Workshop


1. Open Import_data.m [found in: "Scripts"]. Adjust line 5 (Root_dir) of Import_data.m to point to the file path containing PMMA data in your local copy of this repo (i.e., ~/GitHub/matl-db/Non-charring/PMMA/). Run Import_data.m
2. Load and Run the analysis/plotting scripts for each of the experiment types (e.g., TGA, DSC, Gasification, Cone..)[found in: "Scripts"]. Each figure (including those in the Supplemental Information Document) will be saved to the [SCRIPT_FIGURES] folder
3. Compile the file MaCFP_2021_Report_Part_I_Experimental.tex [found in: "Documents"]
