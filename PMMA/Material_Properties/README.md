## PMMA Material Properties

This folder holds calibrated pyrolysis models (i.e., material property datasets) and relevant metadata that identifies how these models were developed.

In March 2023, the UMD Pyrolysis model (material properties defined in MaCFP\_PMMA\_UMD.json) was identified as the most 'central' or 'average' model of those currently available. That is, this model yields predictions closest (sum of square errors) to mean gasification predictions. It is suggested that this paramater set by used by modelers for initial model set (to provide a common set of parameters for MaCFP PMMA). It is NOT implied to be the most accurate property set.

A pyrolysis model validation exercise has been identified to validate the accuracy of submitted PMMA Pyrolysis models. Further information is available online in the [Modeling Guidelines Wiki](https://github.com/MaCFP/macfp-db/wiki/MaCFP-2023-Modeling-Guidelines#additional-guidelines-for-nist-gasification-apparatus).
